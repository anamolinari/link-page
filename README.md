## Project description

<p align="justify">
During my journey in Rocketseat's Introduction to Technology course, I was able to apply my knowledge in developing a significant project: a page for storing links.

This page not only offers a responsive interface, adapting to different devices, but also provides a personalized visual experience with the option to switch between dark and light modes. Furthermore, to enhance usability, the links are configured to open in a new browser tab.

Another interesting feature of the project is the dynamic change of the avatar and background, which accompany the selected theme, adding a touch of personalization and fluidity to the user experience.

Throughout the development of this page, I faced various challenges that encouraged me to enhance my skills in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. From creating the basic structure to implementing advanced features like dark mode/light mode and integrating the dynamic avatar, each step represented an opportunity for learning and growth.

This project not only demonstrates my mastery of fundamental web technologies but also reflects my commitment to providing practical and innovative solutions to enhance the user experience on the internet.
